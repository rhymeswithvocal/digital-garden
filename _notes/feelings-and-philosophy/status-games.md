## Why do folks play status games?

Status games, besides sometimes having rewards like money or sex, are often about an [[assertion of self]].

## Are status games avoidable?

Ironically, being anti-status game can itself become a status game. (e.g. hating on popular media to prove that you're not affected by popularity)
